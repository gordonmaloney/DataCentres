I am writing to you as one of your constituents to express my deep concern regarding the unregulated expansion of data centres in Scotland. 

As someone living in the area, I have personally seen the impact of these developments. <<|userStory|>>

The rapid growth of these facilities poses significant risks to our local environment, energy grid, and community resources. We need our representatives to stand up for sustainable development that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over corporate interests.

I urge you to take action in Parliament to ensure that any future data centre projects are subject to rigorous environmental standards and meaningful community consultation.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this urgent matter and what steps you plan to take to address these concerns.

Sincerely,

<<|userName|>>
