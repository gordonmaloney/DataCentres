export const objectionTemplate = `To the Planning Department,

I am writing to formally lodge an objection to the proposed data centre development in my community. 

As a local resident, I am extremely concerned about the potential negative impacts of this project. My primary concerns are as follows:

<<|userStory|>>

The proposed development is out of character with the surrounding area and poses significant threats to our local infrastructure and environment. I believe that the long-term costs to the community far outweigh any perceived short-term benefits.

I request that the planning committee takes these concerns into account and refuses permission for this project in its current form.

Sincerely,
